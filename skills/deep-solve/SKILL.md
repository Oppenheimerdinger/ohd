name: deep-solve
description: This skill should be used ONLY on explicit request — the user invokes /deep-solve or says "deep solve" / "deep-solve" / "딥솔브" / "solve to convergence" / "delegate and verify". Never auto-trigger for merely hard problems or stuck sessions; but when the session IS stuck on a hard separable problem, add ONE line noting that /deep-solve exists, then continue normally. Once invoked, fits hard self-contained problems with a definite right answer (derivation, proof, algorithm choice, root-cause, design tradeoff).

# Deep Solve

Two phases plus a user gate. Phase 1 (brief convergence) is YOURS —
author-in-the-loop, needs your session context. Then the USER approves the
converged brief. Phase 2 (solution convergence) runs in one of two modes,
chosen during Phase 1:

- **isolated** — deterministic Workflow, unattended, closed-book solvers
  sealed off from the live system. For problems fully closable on paper.
- **grounded** — one fresh tool-having solver + one verifying reviewer,
  attended. For problems whose load-bearing facts must be established against
  the live system.

## Phase 1 — converge the brief (main loop, you)

1. Write a SELF-CONTAINED problem brief (checklist inlined below; lineage:
   delegating-hard-problems). Decide the TENTATIVE mode here (see Mode routing
   below) — a grounded-mode brief needs its Open-questions section written
   before the review loop starts:
   - Every symbol / term / variable defined.
   - Every number, measured value, and fact the solver needs is INLINE.
   - Faithful to the REAL system: cite actual `file:line` and real values, not an
     idealized sketch.
   - Established constraints / what NOT to re-litigate stated.
   - What a valid answer looks like and how it will be validated stated.
   - No "see the session"; no references a fresh agent cannot open.
   - WITHHOLD your own tentative conclusion — the solvers must derive cold.
   - ★EMPIRICAL-PREMISE PROVENANCE: classify every MEASURED claim the problem rests
     on — especially LABELS/attributions connecting a measurement to an entity
     ("kernel X is call Y", "the slow phase is Z") — as (a) directly verified by a
     described experiment, or (b) inherited/inferred. A load-bearing (b) with a
     cheap decisive test (≲30 min) is an UNCLOSED PREMISE: run that test and fold
     the result in BEFORE Phase 2. **A brief with an unclosed cheap-verifiable
     load-bearing premise is NOT converged** — this includes anything you were
     tempted to file under an "honest gap / experiment #0" section: if it is cheap
     and could invalidate the problem statement, it runs NOW, not in the solver's
     ladder. (A 2026-07-04 run lost 5 rounds + an implementation campaign to one
     unverified kernel attribution.)
2. Brief review loop (the bundled review-to-convergence skill's method, executed
   here — NOT in the Workflow,
   because only you can fix the brief):
   - Dispatch a fresh independent reviewer: a general-purpose agent with read
     tools + sandboxed Bash, no write/edit (Agent tool, model = resolved model
     below). Its prompt must include the full brief verbatim and instruct it to
     check FOUR axes — self-contained? faithful? solvable? premise-audited? —
     where "faithful" REQUIRES opening every cited `file:line` in the repo and
     verifying the brief's claims against the actual code/values, and
     "premise-audited" REQUIRES listing each load-bearing MEASURED claim with
     its provenance class ((a) directly verified / (b) inherited-unverified)
     and flagging any (b) that has a cheap decisive test as a BLOCKING finding
     — **running that test itself when it can (read-only, cheap) and inlining
     the result (command + output) instead of just flagging**. It returns a
     findings list (empty list = pass).
   - In grounded mode the reviewer additionally verifies each entry of the
     brief's "Open questions" section: load-bearing? and NOT cheaply closable
     read-only? (If the reviewer can close one itself, that is a finding: the
     fact gets inlined with its command+output, the question removed. A
     non-load-bearing entry is likewise a finding — demote it to a hint or
     drop it.)
   - Fix findings → re-dispatch → repeat until a pass with ZERO findings.
   - If not converged after 4 review iterations, stop and escalate to the user
     instead of looping further.
   - If a read-only reviewer idles without reporting, grep its transcript JSONL
     (under `~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/`) for the final assistant
     message instead of re-prompting.

## Mode routing (decided during Phase 1)

- The brief's validation section cannot be written without live measurement or
  the author's session context → OUT OF SCOPE for deep-solve: say so and
  recommend plain delegation. Same for facts needing WRITE/experiment access.
- Load-bearing facts remain that need live READ access and were not cheaply
  closable in Phase 1 → recommend **grounded**. The brief gains an "Open
  questions to resolve against the live system" section (entries verified by
  the Phase-1 reviewer, above) with starting pointers (hints, not a boundary);
  the brief is then self-contained *modulo* those open questions.
- Otherwise → **isolated**. Speed/cost NEVER picks the mode (budget is a knob).
- The gate banner's mode line must enumerate the SPECIFIC facts that could not
  be closed and why. The user can override with `--mode isolated|grounded`; if
  the user forces isolated mode while open questions remain, state at the gate
  that its grade will rest on those unverified premises.
- This routing is a heuristic, not a proof — **when the call is ambiguous,
  present both options at the user gate with the tradeoff, but ALWAYS
  recommend exactly one.** The gate, not the heuristic, is the final arbiter.

## Resolve overrides (user request → args)

| User said | args |
|---|---|
| "N라운드", "N rounds", "--rounds N" | `maxRounds: N` |
| "리뷰어 N", "N reviewers", "--reviewers N" | `reviewers: N` |
| "패널로", "as a panel" (no number given) | `reviewers: 3` |
| "확증 생략", "skip confirmation", "--no-confirm" | `confirm: false` |
| "fable로", "use fable", "--model fable" | `model: "fable"` |
| "--mode isolated\|grounded", "격리로", "grounded로" | mode override (beats the Phase-1 recommendation) |

Defaults: `maxRounds: 4`, `reviewers: 1`, `confirm: true`, `model: "opus"`.
**fable ONLY on explicit user request — never by default.**

## User gate — approve the brief (MANDATORY, blocks Phase 2)

After the brief review loop converges, present to the user in ONE message:

1. **The converged brief, full text** (quoted block) — the user must be able to
   inspect exactly what the solvers will receive.
2. **The kickoff banner** with the resolved run parameters:

```
▶ deep-solve
  mode     : {isolated|grounded} — {the specific facts that forced the mode, or "fully closed brief"}
  model    : {model} (max effort)
  budget   : up to {maxRounds} solves (incl. confirmation)
  schedule : {expanded}  (may exit early; a good brief finishes in 2)
  reviewers: {reviewers} / confirmation solve: {on|off}
```

In grounded mode the budget/schedule/reviewers lines are replaced by
`run : 1 solver (max effort) · max 1 continuation · 1 verifying reviewer`
(`maxRounds` / `confirm` / `reviewers` args are ignored — say so if the user
set them).

3. **An explicit question**: launch as-is / edit the brief / adjust parameters /
   cancel. Do NOT start Phase 2 — Workflow or manual fallback — until the user
   approves. If the user edits the brief substantively, fold the edits in,
   re-run one brief review pass, and re-present the gate. If the user adjusts
   parameters or makes non-substantive edits, apply them and re-present the
   gate with the updated banner; launch only on an explicit go.

**Pre-approval path**: if the user has explicitly authorized autonomous
execution for this run ("자율적으로 진행", "run autonomously", "승인 생략" /
"skip approval", "게이트 스킵"), do not wait at the gate — but STILL print the
full brief and the banner (the record stands even when the wait is waived),
then launch immediately. Vague delegation ("알아서 해줘" without reference to
this run's approval) does NOT qualify — present the gate normally.
**Grounded mode never runs under this waiver** (it depends on the attended
permission barrier): print the brief + banner, state that grounded mode needs
an attended session, and stop — do NOT switch modes yourself; the user must
explicitly choose isolated mode.

Render everything — banner labels included — in the conversation language (e.g.
Korean labels for a Korean conversation). When `model` is opus, append a short
hint on the model line that the user may request the strongest model (e.g.
`← say "use fable" / "fable로" for the strongest model`); omit the hint otherwise.

`{expanded}` = the schedule written out in full: last slot SYNTH, odd COLD, even
REPAIR — e.g. maxRounds 4 → `COLD → REPAIR → COLD → SYNTH`; maxRounds 6 →
`COLD → REPAIR → COLD → REPAIR → COLD → SYNTH`. NEVER show the odd/even rule to
the user; always print the expanded sequence.

## Phase 2, isolated mode — launch the Workflow (only after user approval)

Invoke the Workflow tool with the script that ships next to this skill:

```
Workflow({
  scriptPath: "<this skill's base directory>/solve-converge.js",
  args: { brief, maxRounds, confirm, reviewers, model }
})
```

The base directory is announced when this skill loads (or supplied by the
invoking command). Do not copy the script elsewhere; do not register it as a
named workflow.

If the Workflow tool is NOT available in this environment, say so to the user
(Phase 2 requires it) and fall back to running the loop manually with the Agent
tool: fresh solver → fresh independent reviewer per round, following the same
schedule and honesty rules.

## Phase 2, grounded mode (attended; no Workflow; only after user approval)

1. **Solver**: one fresh agent, max effort, read tools + sandboxed Bash, no
   write/edit (the attended permission system is the write barrier). Returns:
   answer + reasoning + an **evidence appendix** — verbatim command output or
   `file:line` excerpt for EVERY newly established load-bearing fact — plus
   `premiseChallenge`: a suspect load-bearing premise that is cheaply testable
   read-only must be TESTED by the solver itself and recorded in the appendix
   (a refutation IS the answer); only untestable doubts come back unresolved.
2. **Reviewer**: one fresh agent, same tool regime. Its input is the brief plus
   the solver's RAW return block — never a paraphrase. Duties: (i) review the
   answer against the brief; (ii) produce a per-item **verification table**
   over the appendix — `confirmed / failed / not-reproduced` (re-open files,
   re-run cheap commands; expensive measurements are `not-reproduced`, never
   `confirmed`; `failed` = the re-run materially CONTRADICTS the claim, not
   byte-inequality). A `failed` load-bearing item is a blocking finding;
   (iii) any load-bearing claim WITHOUT an appendix entry is a finding.
3. **Continuation**: on findings, at most ONE continuation; the continuation
   prompt is the brief + the solver's raw return block + the reviewer's raw
   output block (this works whether the same agent is resumed or a new one is
   spawned). Its output gets a FULL re-review by the same reviewer (new or
   changed appendix items added to the table).
4. **Grade** (NEVER `independent-agreement`):
   - zero-finding final pass AND all load-bearing items `confirmed` →
     `grounded-single-solver, reviewer-verified`
   - zero findings but `not-reproduced` load-bearing items or an unresolved
     premise doubt → `grounded-single-solver, partially-verified` (name the
     items on the grade line)
   - findings remain → `unconverged-grounded` (findings attached)
   The final report ALWAYS includes the reviewer's final raw output — findings
   AND table — verbatim next to the grade.
5. **Still failing** after the one continuation → the user chooses: accept as
   unconverged, or return to Phase 1 FRESH (the verification table is attached
   as input evidence to audit — no fact carries over pre-accepted).

## Post-processing (MANDATORY — the return is not user-visible by itself)

Report: `converged` / `evidence` / `roundsUsed` / findings summary (plus
`premiseChallenge` when `evidence` is `"premise-challenge"`). The following
bullets are the ISOLATED-mode Workflow return; grounded mode is handled after
them:

- `converged: true, evidence: "independent-agreement"` → adopt the answer.
- `converged: true, evidence: "reviewer-silence"` → adopt, but tell the user the
  evidence grade was downgraded (no independent confirmation — budget exhausted,
  confirm disabled, or confirmation agent unavailable; they may rerun with a
  larger budget).
- `converged: false, evidence: "premise-challenge"` → the round-1 solver challenged
  a load-bearing, untested premise of the brief itself — this is NOT a solve
  failure. Do NOT adopt `answer` (it is only a conditional best-effort) and do NOT
  relaunch the solver. Read the `premiseChallenge` field (named premise + exact
  cheap test), RUN that test yourself, and fold the result into the brief. If it
  invalidates the premise the problem statement changes; if it confirms it,
  annotate that. Either way re-present the corrected brief at the Phase-1 user
  gate before any relaunch.
- `converged: false` otherwise (budget exhausted; `answer` may be null if no
  attempt was ever reviewed) → do NOT adopt silently and do NOT auto-rerun. The
  best reviewed attempt is still returned in `answer` — show it clearly marked as
  UNCONVERGED alongside its remaining findings. Then either return to Phase 1
  (suspect the brief — the most common root cause; the user gate applies again
  before any relaunch) or escalate to the user.

Grounded-mode results are reported per the grade rules above (grade + verbatim
reviewer output). `reviewer-verified`/`partially-verified` answers are adoptable
with their grade stated; suggest an isolated-mode re-run only when the user
wants reproduction-type evidence on top of grounding.
